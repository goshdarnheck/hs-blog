This is the first post on my new blog! I'm excited to start writing more posts and see where this site can go. I'm not much of a writer but at least I am a decent typist from all of the coding I've done over the years. I'm just going to try to hang on for a little while and see what I can do!

This site has been build with Gatsby. It's my first time using it and so far I have loved the experience. My next post will be on my initial thoughts on the Gatsby framework.
