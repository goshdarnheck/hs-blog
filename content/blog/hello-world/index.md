This is my first post on my new real blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[sport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport).

> The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects
> to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part
> in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities
> (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England").
> American English uses "sports" for both terms.
